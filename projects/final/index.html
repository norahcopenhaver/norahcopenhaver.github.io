    <p class="body-text">
        COLLEGE PARK, Md. — Name, Image and Likeness (NIL) partnerships are becoming a major force 
        across college athletics, and in College Park, local businesses are finding new ways to reach 
        students by teaming up with Maryland athletes instead of relying on traditional advertising.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
        For players, NIL deals offer something they haven’t had before: a way to earn money while 
        juggling the demands of a Division I schedule.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote p-3 border-start border-3">
        <p>“As a college athlete, you don't necessarily have the time — especially for baseball, 
        because everyone has to play summer ball,” Maryland baseball player 
        <strong>Quinn Yellen</strong> said. “You don’t even have the chance to get a summer job. 
        It’s really hard to make money as a college student. So having NIL is an opportunity… 
        you have to go and seek out the opportunities, and you have to do things with them. 
        It's not like you just get paid money for existing.”</p>

        Local restaurants, including Bagels ‘n Grinds and Potomac Pizza, say NIL deals help them create 
        more personal and relatable connections with students compared to standard marketing.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
        Koretsky said the authenticity of athlete partnerships is what makes the huge difference in their partnerships compared to those with larger businesses, such as Under Armor or Celsius. Many data charts from NIL programs for athletes show that in recent years many men's and women's sport's alike have grown in monetary value and income of their NIL deals. Please take a look at this graph from OpenDorse as an example.

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Athletes:</strong> NIL gives student-athletes a chance to earn money in ways that simply were not possible before. For many players, especially those in sports that do not bring in large scholarships, the extra income helps them cover everyday expenses like food, rent, or school supplies. NIL also teaches athletes how to manage contracts, promote themselves, and communicate with brands. These are skills they can use long after they leave college. At the same time, balancing NIL commitments with a full class and practice schedule forces them to stay organized and intentional with their time.</li>
            <li><strong>Businesses:</strong> For local businesses, NIL has become a more personal way to reach students. Instead of spending money on ads that may or may not connect with their audience, restaurants and shops can partner with athletes who students already know and follow. When an athlete promotes a business on campus or on social media, it feels more genuine. These partnerships also help businesses stay connected to the student community in a way that feels natural and relatable.</li>
            <li><strong>Community:</strong> NIL is also helping strengthen ties between athletes and the community around them. When players partner with neighborhood businesses, it brings the campus and the city closer together. Students see familiar faces promoting places they already go to, which helps everything feel more connected. These deals can also lead to community events, charity work, and youth programs. In many ways, NIL is creating new opportunities for athletes to be involved beyond their sport.</li>
